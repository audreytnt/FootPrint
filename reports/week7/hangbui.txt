1) Goals from last week:
- Split the rough plugin into classes (Executor, Listener, Runner, Extractor, Cache). 
Currently all of them are combined together into one class.
- Access watchpoint information from the virtual machine

2) Progress:

- Split plugin into classes (Executor, Listener, Runner, Extractor, Cache)
- Found IntelliJ's API for extracting variables on the stackframe and 
  completed the Extractor class. Since we now have access to these
  variables, we have decided to not pursue watchpoints anymore. 
- Able to print the contents of primitives, arrays, and 
  object's fields values
- Stuck on extracting the contents of Collection variables. Currently,
  we can only print the object's address, not what's inside it. 
- Completed a rough version of the cache (will need to do additional testing
  to verify functionality)


3) Goals for next week:
- Complete VariableInfo class to give the UI all the information it needs
  to display to the user (ex: Object's fields and value in a readable format, )
- Test cache and extractor for the back end
- Add comments to classes
