Previous Goals:

•	Add watchpoints to our current FootPrint prototype
•	Figure out how to store variable data
•   Continue researching JDI
•	Separate into Extractor and Cache teams and begin implementing these

This Week:

We split our code into separate classes for Cache, Extractor, Listener, etc.
We also added some test classes for DebugCache and VariableInfo. We have
the basic implementation of our classes complete and have started on the UI
so we can have a working demo. Currently FootPrint will only extract the
variable data when the debugger is suspended. The watches in intellij
actually were not that useful. It doesn't suspend the debugger
or anything when the watched variable changes. They're more for
evaluating expressions so we haven't been able to use them in our
implementation and the user will still need to set breakpoints. We do plan to add field
watchpoints which are different from watches though. We are able to access
local variables through the Intellij API each time the debugger is suspended.
We are currently working on how to deal with objects (e.g. what info to store, how to display)

Goals:

- add more tests for all classes
- add field watchpoints
- add documentation
- deal with objects, how to store, how to display
- continue working on UI
