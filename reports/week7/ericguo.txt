1. For next week:
    -build a prototype to get local variables
    -investigate using watchpoints to achieve above
2. This week, I did not follow my plan from last week. As a team, we decided to work
   more on getting the basic functionalities of the classes setup. I implemented the
   basic UI in the classes FootPrintToolWindowFactory and FootPrintToolWindow with 
   Derek. I also learned how to register tool window factories in Intellij for this.
3. Future goals:
    -finish the basic UI functionality:
      -displaying arrays
      -displaying changes in the history
    -research new ways to get local variable states
