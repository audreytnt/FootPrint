Goals from Week 6:
-See if watchpoints could help us set the breakpoints automatically.
-Research and consult Martin whether we should try to record local variables and how we could do that.
-Generate unit test cases from the very beginning.
-Start implementing the extractor and listener.

Progress:
-We split our group into backend and frontend. Eric and I worked on the frontend. We built a simple prototype for the FootPrint frontend which could interact with the cache in the backend.
-Eric set up the FootPrintToolWindow and FootPrintToolWindowFactory, which are the key classes for building the interface. I worked on the part that passing the value from the cache to the user interface. \
-The user interface is working properly in displaying all the variables, lines and values. 

Plans and Goals:
-Right now the line numbers are displayed in a wrong way: they are displaying the breakpoints' line numbers instead of the actual line numbers that the varibles change. We are trying to solve this.
-Try to implement getMostRecentUpdate into the user interface
-Try to display and test more complicated cases
