Week 5 Individual Report-Boya Cao


Goals from last week: empty for first week
Progress:- Build a sample plugin following the guide from IntelliJ- Conducted research on how to extract information from debuggers, and compared different type of debuggers- Looked for open source project to have a better understanding how the debuggers work to get the variable information and how the debuggers store them
- We have successfully put a class in a debugger so that we can execute certain methods on our own, and we are able to get simple variable information from the debugger nowPlans and goals:- Test the code to see if it could store the value of more complicated data structure

- Now the FootPrint extracts and stores value based on breakpoints, test if FootPrint could still extract and store the information even if there are bugs before breakpoints- figure out how to record record variable states of every line without setting breakpoints in every line. 

- Research whether the breakpoints could be set automatically.
