First individual report; no previous goals.

We were concerned about the difficulty of our project, especially since no one on the staff has done something
similar before so we were told to create a prototype of our project. We managed to pull one together using
Intellij’s openapi and JDI. Currently we have a plugin that runs the debugger and is able to extract local
variable values in simple cases. Because there is zero documentation for the openapi, we found this process
rather difficult. It involved a lot of just reading the code and trying to figure out what does what.
We also found something called JDI (Java Debug Interface) that is used to write debuggers for Java.
There are lots of tutorials and more documentation for this online so we integrated this into our
approach as well. We’ve also found examples of people making plugins that manipulate the debugger
on Intellij’s forum, which has been useful. Currently, our next challenge is to figure out how to
efficiently store all the variable values at each step. The way it currently works, you have to set
a breakpoint whenever you want to extract data. We were thinking that we would have to have breakpoints
at every line of executed code in order to get all the variable’s history, but aren’t quite sure how
to go about this. We were also hoping to store more than just local variables, but we haven’t found out
how to do so yet.

TO DO:

•	Figure out how to extract variable values at each step/until execution is paused
•	Figure out how to store them
•	Possibly figure out how to store global variables, variables on the heap, etc.
•	Decide on team assignments, who works on what, how we will communicate, etc.
•	Decide on a UI later, draw some mockups for now, outline pros and cons
