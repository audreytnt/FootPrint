1. For next week, I plan to try to learn more about ways we could get the information
   about local variables that we want, perhaps through programatically setting breakpoints.
   I also want to build a working prototype that is also able to get the local variable 
   information at every line.
2. This week, I dug more into the intellij debug api and found that we cannot build a
   seperate backend and front end, as was suggested at our TA meeting. I found that
   intellij's debug solution is build on using jdi and because we must use intellij's
   debug api, it must be specific to that ide. I also transfered some files between the
   test repository (myfootprint) and the project one, and cleaned up some comments. Also,
   I found that we can easily get the states of field's, but it is much more difficult to
   get the states of local variables because of how breakpoints are registered in the
   virtual machine.
3. For next week:
    -build a prototype to get local variables
    -investigate using watchpoints to achieve above
