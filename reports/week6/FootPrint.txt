1. Previous week’s plan: 
 	- Create all the necessary classes with empty methods and comments (i.e. create a spec)
 	- Build version 1 of the Runner, Listener, and Extractor to just track the history of global fields up until a specific breakpoint

2. This week’s progress:
	- Started implementing necessary classes for the Runner, listener and Extractor.
   	- Built a simple model for the IDE talking to the JVM
   	- Researched on the watchpoints to see if the breakpoints could be set automatically.
   	- Since it is difficult to get local variables' information rather than recording the states of fields, we researched on how to record the information of local variables.
   	- Researched more on the JDI

3. Next week’s plan:
 	-Finish the build process of v1.0 Runner, Listener, and Extractor.
 	-Try record states of local variables.

4. Meeting agenda:
   1. Discuss possible approaches to access the states of local variables
   2. Discuss how to utilize watchpoints to help FootPrint access information
