Previous Goals:

•	Figure out how to extract variable values at each step/until execution is paused
•	Figure out how to store them
•	Possibly figure out how to store global variables, variables on the heap, etc.
•	Decide on team assignments, who works on what, how we will communicate, etc.
•	Decide on a UI later, draw some mockups for now, outline pros and cons

This Week:

After our meeting with Martin, we've decided to look into watchpoints more as
as opposed to setting breakpoints everywhere, which seemed very inefficient.
We were also advised to separate the JDI code as the backend of our application and
the frontend Intellij plugin so that it could connect with any debugger, but after
further research on JDI and sockets, it seems rather difficult to do this
due to race conditions and the way the Intellij debugger works but we will
keep looking into it. Also, it seems JDI only offers watchpoint
methods for field/instance variables and not local variables so this is
another issue we would need to solve. In terms of implementation, we haven't
made much progress beyond last week due to all the snow days and midterms,
but we plan to pick up the slack in the coming weeks.

Current Goals:

•	Add watchpoints to our current FootPrint prototype
•	Figure out how to store variable data
•   Continue researching JDI
•	Separate into Extractor and Cache teams and begin implementing these
